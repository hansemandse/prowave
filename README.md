# ProWave: WaveNet-based Protein Generation
This repository contains all code required for our final project in the course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU.

We have implemented a [WaveNet](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio)-based protein generator inspired primarily by work done by Ali Madani et al. in [ProGen: Language Modeling for Protein Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03497.pdf). The implementation is described in the Jupyter notebook file `./src/EXE.ipynb`.
